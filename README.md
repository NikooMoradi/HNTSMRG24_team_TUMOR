# Comparative Analysis of nnUNet and MedNeXt for Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation in MRI-guided Radiotherapy

Welcome to the repository for our solution to the **HNTS-MRG24 MICCAI Challenge**, where we achieved first place in Task 1 (pre-radiotherapy segmentation) using advanced deep learning methods for automatic segmentation of primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) and metastatic node gross tumor volume (GTVn) in MRI scans. This repository provides a step-by-step guide to reproduce our results, including model training, ensembling, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Overview

The **HNTS-MRG24 MICCAI Challenge** focuses on the segmentation of head and neck tumors in MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy. Our solution utilizes the **nnUNet** and **MedNeXt** models, combined with multi-level ensembling to improve segmentation accuracy. The final solution achieved a **mean DSCagg of 0.8254** for Task 1 and **0.7005** for Task 2.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the **HNTS-MRG24 dataset** provided by the challenge organizers, consisting of MRI images from 150 head and neck cancer patients. The dataset includes:
- **Pre-RT T2-weighted MRI scans** with segmentation masks for GTVp and GTVn.
- **Mid-RT T2-weighted MRI scans** for Task 2, with pre-registered pre-RT images to facilitate training.

[//]: < ## Installation >

[//]: < To set up the environment and install dependencies:>
[//]: < ```bash>
[//]: < # Clone the repository>
[//]: < git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HNTS-MRG24-Segmentation>
[//]: < cd HNTS-MRG24-Segmentation>

[//]: < # Install dependencies>
[//]: < pip install -r requirements.txt>

This project requires a GPU for model training. Recommended specifications:

- **6 NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs**
- **48 GB VRAM**
- **1024 GB RAM**

## Workflow

### Data Preparation
--coming soon--
### Model Training

We utilized **nnUNet** and **MedNeXt** models with the following configurations:

- **Task 1**: Pre-trained on mid-RT and registered pre-RT images, fine-tuned on original pre-RT images.
- **Task 2**: Multi-channel input with mid-RT images, registered pre-RT images, and registered pre-RT segmentation masks.

[//]: < Scripts for training models are in `src/model_training/`. Model configurations and parameters are included in each script for reproducibility.>

### Ensemble Strategy

To improve segmentation performance, we implemented a multi-level ensemble approach:

1. **nnUNet Ensembles**: Predictions from FullRes, Cascade, and ResEnc configurations were combined using `nnUNetv2_ensemble`.
3. **Average Ensemble**: Combined predictions from nnUNet and MedNeXt for the final segmentation.

[//]: < The ensemble process is described in `src/ensemble.py`.>

### Evaluation

The primary evaluation metric is the **Aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSCagg)**. We report results for each configuration and use per-sample Dice scores to assess model robustness. 

[//]: < The evaluation code is available in `src/evaluation.py`.>

## Results

### Quantitative Results
